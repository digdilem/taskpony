# Roadmap

Where Taskpony is going.

Some features for the future that may, or may not, be added. 

- Probably:
  - Configurable and automated deletion of tasks more than NN days since completion, or delete more than NN recent tasks. (Beware repeatable tasks, will need check so that period can't be less than those and vice versa or a repeating task could get deleted before it has a chance to re-activate.)

- Maybe:
  - A priority system. Poss 3 dots on each task in list for one-touch change. Low, medium, high? Sorted accordingly?
  - Add default sorting option, rather than just newest-first.
  - Add colour to tasks. (Possibly based on priority, possibly a per-task setting. Beware making things too messy)
  - Multi-language support.
  - Daily email report. Possibly showing outstanding tasks from Default list and summary stats.
  - Some sort of toggleable daily progress badge "N tasks done today". Unsure of need/benefit.
  - Ability to undelete Lists
  - A self refreshing ability when another client changes the database, so it's displaying the latest info.
  - A history table for tasks and actions. Extra detail for tasks for recurring tasks, when lists were created, changed etc.
  - Move Export buttons toggle from Settings to a button on the top group, but cautious of making that too cluttered.
  

- Unlikely:
  - A List Template system. This might be where you can create a list with a pre-defined set of Tasks already populating it. This might be useful for for repeatable workflows. This may be overly complex to define, however.
  - Groups / teams / shared and embeddded tasks. 
  - Authentication, https. 
  - Plugins.
